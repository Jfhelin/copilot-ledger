// Pure cost-comparison logic for two parsed Copilot Chat exports.

// copilotChatExportParser.ts) and produces everything the CostCompare view
// needs to render. NO side effects, NO LLM calls, NO formatting. Formatting
// is done in the view.
//
// Design notes:
//   - "Fixed" buckets = system, tool_defs (workspace context lives in
//     `current` per-prompt-1 in Copilot Chat exports; we treat it as
//     fixed per call IF the bucket value is large and nearly identical
//     between calls -- but for v1 we keep the definition simple).
//   - "Variable" = history + tool_results + current + response (output).
//   - Answer equivalence: byte-equal final responsePreview, after
//     trim+collapse-whitespace+lowercase.
//   - Buckets we compare across runs match the existing CostView buckets
//     in `CTX_KEYS`: system, tool_defs, history, tool_results, current,
//     output.

// @ts-ignore -- pricing.js has no .d.ts but the function we use is well-typed in practice.

/**
 * Projects a per-call prefix-token tax over the actual call shape of a parsed
 * run. The math: for each primary LLM call, compute its effective per-input-
 * token cost (using the model's known output rate to subtract output cost
 * from total cost), then add `extraInputTokens * perInputTokenCost` to the
 * projection. Cache amortization is automatic -- a call that ran 95% cache-
 * hit has a tiny per-input-token cost, so adding tokens to it adds little
 * cost. Calls with unknown pricing (cost == 0) contribute zero by design;
 * we'd rather underreport than fabricate.
 *
 * Use this with `divergenceSplit.preInputDelta` to answer:
 *   "If every primary call had paid this prefix tax, what would the run
 *    have cost?"
 *
 * Caveats baked in:
 *   - This is a LOWER BOUND. It assumes the agent's path stays identical.
 *     Real prefix changes can shift behavior, which this number won't catch.
 *   - The per-token cost is the call's average input rate (cached, fresh, and
 *     cache-write blended). True marginal cost depends on whether the extra
 *     tokens land in cache-hit or cache-miss; the blended average is a fair
 *     approximation when the prefix is stable across calls.
